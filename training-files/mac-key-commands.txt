(esc)Escape: Use it to cancel a previous command. Never underestimate the power of the Esc key to get you out of trouble.

That's basically the principle of Esc.




Useful Developer Shortcuts

(⌘)Command + (⇧)Shift + L: If you feel confident and comfortable to select all instances that match the phrase you've selected at one time, then give this shortcut a try.
